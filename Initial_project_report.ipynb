    "| ----------- | ----------- |\n",
    "| bedrooms | The number of bedrooms in the property. Bedrooms refer to individual rooms used primarily for sleeping and are typically found in residential properties. |\n",
    "| bathrooms | The number of bathrooms in the property. Bathrooms refer to rooms containing a toilet, sink, and typically a bathtub or shower, used for personal hygiene. |\n",
    "| sqr_feet | The total square footage of the property. Square footage is a measurement of the area covered by the property, indicating its size or living space. It is often used to estimate the property's value or to determine the price per square foot. |\n",
    "| tax_value | The assessed value of the property for tax purposes. Tax value represents the estimated worth of the property as determined by the local tax authority. It is used to calculate property taxes. |\n",
    "| year_built | The year in which the property was constructed or built. This indicates the age of the property and can be useful in assessing its condition or historical significance. |\n",
    "| tax_amount | The amount of tax owed on the property. Tax amount refers to the actual dollar amount that needs to be paid in property taxes based on the assessed tax value and local tax rates. |\n",
    "| county | The county where the property is located. County refers to a specific geographic region or administrative division within a state or country. It helps identify the property's location within a broader jurisdiction. |\n"
